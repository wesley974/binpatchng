binpatchng 2.1.3
----------------

- Drop (x)etc sets
- Add support for setting REVISION
- Various documentation tweaks

binpatchng 2.1.2
----------------

- Rework how PATCH_NAME is set, resolving two issues:
  - "@comment patch for" got populated incorrectly
  - pre-populating PATCH_COMMON/PATCH_KERNEL didn't work anymore

binpatchng 2.1.1
----------------

- Improved handling of variables that may be shadowed by variables
  intended for ports.

binpatchng 2.1.0
----------------

- For patches with both libraries and binaries, ensure the binaries link with
  the new libraries.
- Support building a package's components in parallel via PARALLEL_BUILDS.
- Make handling directories in the PLIST more robust as to prevent warnings
  upon package removal.

binpatchng 2.0.0
----------------

- Verify patches with signify(1).
- Default to signing packages with signify(1).

binpatchng 1.9.8
----------------

- Make $FIND_OPTS a per-patch setting for finer control.
- Use correct wrksrc directory for Xenocara patches.
- Cleanup /var/db/binpatch upon removal of the binpatch.
- Unbreak 'install' target if the package wasn't yet built.
- Remove support for non-package (i.e. tar) mode.

binpatchng 1.9.6
----------------

- Allow building binpatches on architectures where the application architecture
  is not equal to the kernel architecture. Fixes building on various platforms
  such as 'arm', 'mips64', etc.

binpatchng 1.9.4
----------------

- Adjust bsd.mp handling on clean installs and don't do any kernel tasks
  for non-kernel patches.
- When performing a rollback, fixup permissions just like we do for install.
- Preserver permissions when copying the rollback kernel.

binpatchng 1.9.2
----------------

- Adjust kernel installation to behave like the OpenBSD installer with regard
  to installing bsd.mp on systems with multiple processors.
- Tweak rollback procedure for systems without bsd.mp
- Adjust dependencies in bsd.binpatch.mk
- Sign packages by default

binpatchng 1.9
--------------

- add FIND_OPTS to allow appending to the default find(1) options when searching
  for modified files.
- rename binpatch packages to binpatch${OSREV}-${ARCH}-${component}-${VERSION},
  like binpatch52-amd64-kernel-1.0.
- add a new 'fetch' target which moves all the retrieving of distfiles
  from 'extract' and 'init' into a standalone 'fetch' target
- mention the named patches used to build a particular binpatch in
  DESCR, instead of listing the full patch. the full patch is stored
  in /var/db/binpatch/
- fix install target for packages
- allow for binpatches to get updated. this means that updates work
  with binpatches just like they do with other packages.
- fine grained rollback support allowing to rollback nothing,
  everything or just kernels.
- make it possible to set a maintainer of the package.
- simplify MASTER_SITE and DIST_SUBDIR handling.
- store a FULLPKGPATH in the package, like pkgpath=/binpatchng/52/001
- 'make depend' is no longer needed for kernel compiles.
- make FTP transfers less verbose by default and ensure all transfers
  use the FETCH_CMD variable, instead of hardcoding 'ftp'.
- make it possible to override the FTP arguments, to allow for
  transfers through picky firewalls if needed.
- various cleanups.

binpatchng 1.2
--------------

- support the signing mechanism from pkg_create in OpenBSD 4.5.
- proper signing support for gzsig.
- fix behaviour when patch is downloaded and used, this could lead to an
  empty patch name.
- Makefiles all through OpenBSD 4.0 to 4.5.


binpatchng 1.1
--------------

- stick ${OSREV} into the stagingarea name, so that no harm happens if
  the stagingarea is not cleared in between OS upgrades.
- embedded check wether a rollback package actually exists, before trying
  to rollbacking it.
- various cleanups.
